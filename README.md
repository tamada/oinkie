Detecting software theft, the birthmark toolkit for LLVM IR and BC.

## :speaking_head: Overview

Software theft is difficult to detect because it is conducted stealthily, and the source code of the stolen software remains private.
Compilers and their options sensitively alter the binary formats (including executables) of software.
The problem is further complicated by the vast amount of software worldwide.
Therefore, we need a method to detect software theft targeting binary formats from large software repositories.

For this, Tamada et al. proposed the concept of software birthmarking in 2004.
It refers to the native characteristics of the programs and allows for comparison between them.
The similarities of the two birthmarks reflect how similar the original programs are.

This toolkit extracts them from the binary code and compares them to calculate the similarities between two birthmarks.
The high similarity suggests that either program is suspected of being a copy of the other.

## :info: About

### The origin of the tool name `oinkie`

The previous version of this tool is [`pochi`](https://github.com/tamada/pochi), which is the birthmark toolkit for the JVM platform. The `pochi` is a dog that said "dig dig, here" and finds the treasures in the Japanese old tale "The old man who made flowers bloom." The tool finds clues of piracy from the binary code, as illustrated by the example of the dog above.

The purpose of `oinkie` is the same as `pochi` for the other platform, LLVM IR/BC. Hence, another tool name is wanted, such as an animal, a concept, or a famous person. From this background, I came up with an idea for a pig that finds a truffle. However, truffle is already used in [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/graalvm-as-a-platform/language-implementation-framework/). Then, I asked Microsoft Copilot, What is the famous name of the truffle pig? The name `oinkie` is one answer to the question.
